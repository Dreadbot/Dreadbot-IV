Dreadbot-Test
=============


To do (In order of greatest to least importance):

* max speed should be configurable by the driver on the operator console.
* drive->Auto(float xdist, float ydist, float rot, bool drivemode); translate the position and rotation of the robot a specified number of inches and degrees
* make sure each wheel is going at the speed it's set to be at with a PID controller and encoders.
* enable both mechanum (strafe) and arcade drive control via the D-pad.
* let the driver manually make the robot dance by holding down A and pressing the top/bumper buttons (i.e. if A isn't pressed, those buttons would function as they normally would)
